## High Priority Improvements

### 1. Response Caching

**Current:** Every query generates fresh response

**Improvement:**
- Cache common query-response pairs
- Use semantic similarity to match queries
- Instant responses for cached queries

**Benefits:**
- 100x faster for repeated questions
- Zero GPU usage for cache hits
- Better battery life

**Implementation:**
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

cache = {}  # query_embedding -> response
encoder = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')  # 80MB

def get_cached_response(query):
    query_emb = encoder.encode(query)
    # Find similar cached query
    # Return cached response if similarity > 0.9
```

**Cost:** +80MB model, instant response

---

### 2. Multi-turn Context Compression

**Current:** Stores full conversation history

**Improvement:**
- Summarize old conversation turns
- Keep recent turns verbatim
- Compress older context

**Benefits:**
- Longer conversations possible
- Lower token usage
- Faster inference

**Implementation:**
```python
if len(history) > 10:
    # Summarize turns 0-5
    old_summary = llm.generate("Summarize: " + turns[0:5])
    # Keep turns 6-10 verbatim
    context = old_summary + turns[6:10]
```

---

### 3. Proactive Behavior

**Current:** Reactive only (responds to commands)

**Improvement:**
- Generate proactive suggestions
- Detect user needs from patterns
- Offer help unprompted

**Use cases:**
```
Brain detects: User looking for something (pacing, searching)
→ Proactively asks: "Can I help you find something?"

Memory pattern: Coffee every 8 AM
→ At 7:55 AM: "Would you like me to check the coffee machine?"
```

**Implementation:**
- Add behavior trigger conditions
- Pattern matching from memory
- Confidence threshold for interruption

---

### 4. Multi-step Reasoning

**Current:** Single-pass LLM generation

**Improvement:**
- Chain-of-thought prompting
- Break complex queries into steps
- Self-verification

**Example:**
```
Query: "Find all windows and check if they're closed"

Step 1: List all windows (query memory for room layout)
Step 2: Plan navigation route
Step 3: Execute checks
Step 4: Report results
```

**Benefits:**
- Better complex task handling
- Explainable reasoning
- Error detection

---

### 5. Model Quantization Optimization

**Current:** Generic 4-bit quantization

**Improvement:**
- Custom quantization for specific models

---

### 8. Response Quality Scoring

**Current:** No quality check

**Improvement:**
- Self-evaluate response quality
- Regenerate if quality low
- Confidence scoring

**Implementation:**
```python
response = llm.generate(prompt)
quality = evaluate_response(response, query)

if quality < 0.7:
    # Regenerate with different temperature
    response = llm.generate(prompt, temperature=0.9)
```

---

### 9. Memory-augmented Generation

**Current:** Simple memory retrieval

**Improvement:**
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Vector search in memory
- Inject relevant memories automatically

**Benefits:**
- More accurate responses
- Better use of stored knowledge
- Longer-term memory access

---

### 10. Parallel Processing

**Current:** Sequential processing

**Improvement:**
- Process perception updates in background
- Async LLM inference
- Non-blocking memory queries

**Benefits:**
- Lower latency
- Better responsiveness

## Known Limitations

1. **LLM latency** - 200ms minimum (model dependent)
2. **Memory intensive** - 2-3GB for Phi-3.5
3. **GPU required** - CPU inference too slow
4. **No streaming** - Batch generation only
5. **English-optimized** - Best in English
6. **Context limit** - Even 128K has limits
7. **Hallucination** - LLMs can generate false information

---

## Troubleshooting

**LLM won't load:**
```
Check:
1. GPU available? (nvidia-smi)
2. Enough RAM? (free -h)
3. Dependencies installed? (pip list)
4. Model downloaded? (check ~/.cache/huggingface)
```

**Out of memory:**
```
Solutions:
1. Use BitNet instead of Phi-3.5
2. Reduce max_tokens to 100
3. Disable other GPU-heavy modules
4. Use 8-bit instead of 4-bit (paradoxically uses less RAM)
```

**Slow responses:**
```
Solutions:
1. Use BitNet for speed
2. Enable response caching
3. Reduce max_tokens
4. Increase temperature (faster sampling)
```
